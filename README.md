# Python-3-Complete-MasterClass

These programs were developed as practice during the "Python-3-Complete-Masterclass". Great course! 

List of programs

1) Scientific Calculator: A very basic scientific calculator that performs arithmetic operations using the "math" module, it has no graphic UI and minimal error handling. 
2) Excel Automation: Built around openpyxl and a test sheet (added for reference) to make changes in an Excel spreadsheet.
3) Database Automation: A script that uses Psycopg2 for basic database management. 
4) Network application: Have you ever wanted to accept unknown keys through SSH? Now you can, with this basic script that explores how to automate the validation of IPs and also lets you connect to a device. Paramiko SSHv2 Protocol. 
5) Webscraping: Using pandas and BeautifulSoup, this scripts fills some lists for the information that we desire. 


Note: Inside every folder you will also find some invaluable cheatsheets that I used during the course, they are amazing for documentation purposes on every single script. I suggest to start with them first if you are not familiar with the libraries being used.
